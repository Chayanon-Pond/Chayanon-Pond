👋 Hello My name is Pond👋<br>
  Nice to meet you💞️<br>
  I am Full Stack Developer. (but I'm learning in everyday)(beginner)🔭 🌱
  That's a solid professional summary! It effectively communicates your technical foundation and shows how you connect your mathematical background to practical development work. The emphasis on scalability and business impact demonstrates that you think beyond just writing code.
A few thoughts that might help strengthen it further:
The mathematical foundation is a nice differentiator - many developers don't highlight that analytical background. If you have specific examples of how that mathematical thinking has helped you solve complex problems or optimize solutions, that could be powerful to mention in interviews or expanded profiles.
The combination of React and Node.js shows full-stack capability, and mentioning "scalable applications" suggests you understand performance considerations. The business workflow angle is smart too - it shows you understand the "why" behind the code, not just the "how."
